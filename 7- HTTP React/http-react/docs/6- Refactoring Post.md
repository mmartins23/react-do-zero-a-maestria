# Refactoring Post

Let's analyze this:

```javascript
// 5- Refactoring Post
useEffect(() => {
    const httpRequest = async () => {
        if (method === "POST") {
            let fetchOptions = [url, config];

            const res = await fetch(...fetchOptions);

            const json = await res.json();

            setCallFetch(json);
        }
    }
    httpRequest();
}, [config, method, url])
```

This block of code is a `useEffect` hook that observes changes in the `config`, `method`, and `url` variables. When any of these variables change, this hook executes and performs a fetch operation. 

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **Conditional Check**: It first checks if the method is "POST". If it is, it proceeds with the fetch operation, otherwise, it does nothing.

2. **Setting Fetch Options**: It prepares the options for the fetch request. The URL and configuration object (`config`) are combined into an array called `fetchOptions`.

3. **Fetching Data**: It performs the fetch operation using the spread operator (`...fetchOptions`). This effectively spreads the elements of `fetchOptions` as arguments for the fetch function.

4. **Parsing Response**: It awaits the response (`res`) and parses it as JSON.

5. **Updating State**: It updates the state variable `callFetch` with the parsed JSON response.

6. **Dependencies**: The `useEffect` hook has dependencies of `config`, `method`, and `url`. This means it will execute whenever any of these variables change.

The purpose of this refactoring seems to be separating the logic for making the POST request into its own `useEffect` hook, which is a cleaner approach compared to having all the logic inside the `handleSubmit` function. This separation of concerns can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
