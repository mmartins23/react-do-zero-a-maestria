# Creating the project components

This code snippet represents the main component `App` of a React application. Let's break it down:

1. **CSS Style**:
   ```javascript
   import './App.css';
   ```
   - This line imports the CSS file `App.css` to apply styles to the components rendered within the `App` component.

2. **Hooks**:
   ```javascript
   import { useCallback, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   ```
   - This line imports hooks from the React library. Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` are used for managing state, performing side effects, and optimizing performance, respectively.

3. **Components**:
   ```javascript
   import StartScreen from './components/StartScreen';
   import Game from './components/Game';
   import GameOver from './components/GameOver';
   ```
   - These lines import the components `StartScreen`, `Game`, and `GameOver` from their respective files. These components represent different screens or stages of the game.

4. **Data**:
   ```javascript
   import { wordsList } from './data/word';
   ```
   - This line imports the `wordsList` data from the `./data/word` file. This data likely contains a list of words used in the game.

5. **Stages of the game**:
   ```javascript
   const stages = [
     { id: 1, name: "start" }, 
     { id: 2, name: "game" }, 
     { id: 3, name: "end" }
   ]
   ```
   - This defines an array `stages` containing objects representing different stages of the game. Each object has an `id` and a `name`, where the `name` represents the stage such as "start", "game", or "end".

6. **App Component**:
   ```javascript
   function App() {
     const [gameStage, setGameStage] = useState(stages[0].name);
     const [words] = useState(wordsList);
     
     return (
       <div className="App">
         {gameStage === 'start' && <StartScreen/>}
         {gameStage === 'game' && <Game/>}
         {gameStage === 'end' && <GameOver/>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - This is the main `App` component of the React application.
   - It uses the `useState` hook to manage the `gameStage` state, initialized with the first stage `"start"`.
   - The `wordsList` data is stored in the `words` state.
   - Inside the `return` statement, it renders different components based on the `gameStage` state. If the `gameStage` is `"start"`, it renders the `StartScreen` component. If it's `"game"`, it renders the `Game` component. If it's `"end"`, it renders the `GameOver` component.

Overall, this code sets up the basic structure of the React application, including importing necessary resources, defining game stages, and rendering different components based on the current game stage.
