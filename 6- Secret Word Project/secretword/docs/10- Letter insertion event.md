# Letter insertion event

The Letter insertion event in the `Game` component is triggered when the user submits a letter guess. Let's break down how this event is handled:

1. **State Initialization**:
   - The component initializes state using the `useState` hook. It creates a state variable `letter` to hold the current letter input by the user.

2. **Ref Creation**:
   - The component also creates a ref named `letterInputRef` using the `useRef` hook. This ref is used to focus on the input field after submitting a letter.

3. **Handle Submit Function**:
   - The `handleSubmit` function is invoked when the user submits the letter guess. It takes an event object `e` as a parameter.
   - It prevents the default form submission behavior by calling `e.preventDefault()`.
   - It then calls the `verifyLetter` function passed down as a prop from the parent component (`App`). This function is responsible for verifying the guessed letter.
   - After verifying the letter, it clears the `letter` state by calling `setLetter("")`.
   - Finally, it focuses on the input field using the `focus()` method on the `letterInputRef.current`.

4. **Rendering**:
   - The component renders a form containing an input field and a button.
   - The input field allows users to input a single letter guess. Its value is controlled by the `letter` state, and its `onChange` event updates the `letter` state accordingly.
   - The form's `onSubmit` event is set to trigger the `handleSubmit` function when the user submits the form, typically by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "Play" button.

5. **Display**:
   - After submitting a letter, the game UI updates to show the guessed letters and blank squares. Guessed letters are displayed as part of the word, while blank squares represent letters that have not been guessed yet.

Overall, the Letter insertion event in the `Game` component provides users with a way to input a single letter guess and handles the logic for verifying the guess and updating the game state accordingly.
