# useReducer Steps

To use the `useReducer` hook in React, follow these steps:

1. **Import `useReducer`**: Import the `useReducer` hook from the React library.

    ```javascript
    import { useReducer } from 'react';
    ```

2. **Define the Reducer Function**: Create a reducer function that specifies how the state should be updated based on dispatched actions. The reducer function takes two arguments: the current state and an action, and returns the new state.

    ```javascript
    const reducer = (state, action) => {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
          return state + 1;
        case 'DECREMENT':
          return state - 1;
        default:
          return state;
      }
    };
    ```

3. **Initialize the State**: Define the initial state value that will be managed by the reducer function.

    ```javascript
    const initialState = 0;
    ```

4. **Use the `useReducer` Hook**: Call the `useReducer` hook inside your functional component, passing the reducer function and initial state as arguments. It returns an array containing the current state and a dispatch function.

    ```javascript
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    ```

5. **Dispatch Actions**: To update the state, you dispatch actions by calling the `dispatch` function with an action object. The action object typically has a `type` property to indicate the type of action, along with any additional data needed to update the state.

    ```javascript
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
    ```

6. **Accessing State**: You can access the current state value stored by the reducer using the `state` variable returned by `useReducer`.

    ```javascript
    console.log(state); // Output: 0
    ```

Here's a complete example demonstrating the use of `useReducer`:

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const initialState = 0;

const Counter = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const increment = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  };

  const decrement = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter</h1>
      <p>Count: {state}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this example, the `Counter` component uses `useReducer` to manage a simple counter state. It dispatches `INCREMENT` and `DECREMENT` actions to update the state, and the current count is displayed in the UI.
