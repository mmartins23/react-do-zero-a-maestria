# useState steps

To create and use `useState` in React, follow these steps:

1. **Import `useState` from React**:
   Start by importing the `useState` hook from the React library. This hook allows functional components to manage state.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Declare State Variables**:
   Within your functional component, declare state variables using the `useState` hook. Each state variable is paired with a setter function returned by `useState`.

   ```javascript
   const [stateVariable, setStateVariable] = useState(initialValue);
   ```

   - `stateVariable`: Name of the state variable.
   - `setStateVariable`: Corresponding setter function to update the state variable.
   - `initialValue`: Initial value of the state variable.

3. **Use State Variables**:
   You can use the state variables and their setter functions within your component to manage state. These functions allow you to read and update the state values.

   ```javascript
   return (
     <div>
       <p>State Variable: {stateVariable}</p>
       <button onClick={() => setStateVariable(newValue)}>Update State</button>
     </div>
   );
   ```

   - `stateVariable`: Access the current value of the state variable.
   - `setStateVariable(newValue)`: Update the state variable to a new value.

4. **Example**:
   Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of `useState`:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useState } from 'react';

   const Counter = () => {
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

     const increment = () => {
       setCount(count + 1);
     };

     const decrement = () => {
       setCount(count - 1);
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <h2>Counter</h2>
         <p>Count: {count}</p>
         <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
         <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default Counter;
   ```

   In this example, `useState` is used to manage the count state variable. Two functions, `increment` and `decrement`, are used to update the count state variable accordingly.

That's it! You have successfully created and used `useState` in React to manage component state.
