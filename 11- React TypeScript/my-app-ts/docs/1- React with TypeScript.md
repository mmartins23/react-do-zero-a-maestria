# Installing React with Typescript

To install React with TypeScript, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a React project**: If you don't have a React project set up yet, you can create one using `create-react-app`, which is a popular tool for setting up React projects.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

Replace `my-app` with the name of your project.

2. **Navigate to your project directory**:

```bash
cd my-app
```

3. **Start the development server**:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server and open your React app in your default web browser.

That's it! Now you have a React project set up with TypeScript. You can start building your application by editing the files in the `src` directory.

If you prefer using `yarn`, you can use it instead of `npm`:

```bash
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app
yarn start
```

These steps will set up a basic React project with TypeScript, allowing you to take advantage of static typing and other benefits TypeScript provides.
