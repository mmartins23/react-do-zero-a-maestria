# useEffects steps

To create and use `useEffect` in React, follow these steps:

1. **Import `useEffect` from React**:
   Start by importing the `useEffect` hook from the React library. This hook allows functional components to perform side effects.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Declare the Effect**:
   Within your functional component, declare the effect using the `useEffect` hook. This hook accepts two arguments: a function containing the effect, and an optional array of dependencies.

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Effect code
   }, [dependency1, dependency2, ...]);
   ```

   - **Effect Function**: This function contains the code that performs the side effect, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation.
   - **Dependencies**: An optional array containing variables that the effect depends on. If any of these dependencies change, the effect will be re-executed.

3. **Use the Effect**:
   Inside the effect function, you can perform any side effects necessary for your component. This may include fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM.

   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Fetch data from API
     fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => {
         // Update state or perform other actions with data
       });

     // Subscribe to events
     const subscription = eventEmitter.on('eventName', () => {
       // Handle event
     });

     // Clean-up code (optional)
     return () => {
       // Unsubscribe from events or perform other clean-up tasks
       subscription.unsubscribe();
     };
   }, [dependency]);
   ```

   - **Clean-up Function**: Optionally, you can return a function from the effect. This function will be called when the component unmounts or before re-running the effect. It is used to clean up any resources created by the effect, such as unsubscribing from events or cancelling asynchronous tasks.

4. **Example**:
   Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of `useEffect` to fetch data from an API:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   const DataComponent = () => {
     const [data, setData] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
         .then(response => response.json())
         .then(data => {
           setData(data);
         });
     }, []);

     return (
       <div>
         {data ? (
           <ul>
             {data.map(item => (
               <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
             ))}
           </ul>
         ) : (
           <p>Loading data...</p>
         )}
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default DataComponent;
   ```

   In this example, `useEffect` is used to fetch data from an API when the component mounts. The fetched data is stored in the component's state (`data`). The effect has an empty dependency array, indicating that it should only run once when the component mounts.

That's it! You have successfully created and used `useEffect` in React to perform side effects in functional components.
