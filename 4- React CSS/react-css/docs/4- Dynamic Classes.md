# Dynamic Classes

Dynamic classnames in React can be achieved by conditionally applying classnames based on component state, props, or any other logic. Here's a step-by-step explanation with code examples:

### Step 1: Define CSS Classes:

First, define your CSS classes with different styles that you want to apply conditionally.

```css
/* styles.css */
.normal {
  color: black;
}

.highlight {
  color: blue;
}

.error {
  color: red;
}
```

### Step 2: Import CSS Stylesheet:

Import the CSS stylesheet into your React component file where you want to use dynamic classnames.

```jsx
// MyComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import './styles.css'; // Import CSS stylesheet
```

### Step 3: Define Component with Dynamic Classnames:

Define your React component and conditionally apply classnames based on some logic. You can use ternary operators, logical operators, or any other JavaScript expressions to determine which classnames to apply.

```jsx
// MyComponent.jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './styles.css'; // Import CSS stylesheet

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p className={count === 0 ? 'normal' : count < 5 ? 'highlight' : 'error'}>

      </p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Explanation:

- In this example, we have a `MyComponent` functional component that maintains a state variable `count`.
- We conditionally apply classnames to the `<p>` element based on the value of `count`.
- If `count` is `0`, we apply the `normal` classname. If `count` is less than `5`, we apply the `highlight` classname. Otherwise, we apply the `error` classname.
- When the button is clicked, the `count` state is incremented, triggering a re-render of the component and updating the classnames accordingly.

### Summary:

Dynamic classnames in React allow you to conditionally apply styles to elements based on component state, props, or any other logic. By dynamically applying classnames, you can create more flexible and interactive user interfaces in your React applications.
