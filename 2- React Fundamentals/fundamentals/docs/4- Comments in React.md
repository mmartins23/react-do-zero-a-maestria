# Comments in React 

In React, you can add comments inside components using standard JavaScript comment syntax. Here's how you can add comments within a component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* This is a comment inside JSX */}
      <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>
      {/* 
        Multi-line comment example.
        You can add detailed explanations here.
      */}
      <p>This is a JSX element.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In the example above:

- Single-line comments are added using `{/* */}` syntax within curly braces.
- Multi-line comments can also be added inside curly braces as shown above.

These comments will not be rendered to the DOM. They are purely for developer documentation and can help explain the purpose or functionality of specific parts of your component.
